{pstd}
 {cmd:tscb} implements the Two-Stage Cluster Bootstrap Estimator (TSCB), a bootstrap variance
 estimator proposed by {help tscb##TSCB:Abadie et al. (2023)}, for models where average treated
 effects are desired, and where standard error estimates need to account for clustering.
 The TSCB is a variance estimate which considers both the standard sampling component which
 induces variance in estimated regression coefficients, but also incorporates a design-based
 component, accounting for variability in estimates owing to treatment assignment mechanisms.
 When the data which is used to estimate treatment effects includes an important proportion of
 clusters in the full population, standard cluster-robust standard errors can be significantly
 inflated, and the CCV produces a correction for this.
{p_end}

{pstd}
The TSCB work in two stages. First, the fraction treated for each cluster is drawn from empirical distribution of cluster-specific treatment fraction. Second, we samples the treated and control units from each cluster, with their number of units determined in the first stage. The algorithm is explained in detail in {help tscb##TSCB:Abadie et al. (2023)}.
{p_end}

{pstd}
  The {cmd:tscb} command is closely related to the {cmd:ccv} (Causal Cluster
   Variance) command.  {cmd:ccv}
   (if installed) implements an analytic version of the cluster
   variance formula of {help tscb##TSCB:Abadie et al. (2023)}, and shares quite a
   similar syntax and logic.

{dlgtab:Main}
{phang}
{opt qk}({it:#})  Indicates the proportion of clusters from the population which are
sampled in the data. This value should be strictly greater than 0, and less than
or equal to 1.  Values of 1 imply that all clusters are observed in the data,
whereas values less than 1 imply that only this proportion of clusters were sampled.
This is required. 

{pstd}
{p_end}
 {phang}
{opt fe} Indicates that the underlying estimator desired is a fixed effects estimator
where the dependent variable is regressed on treatment exposure as well as {opt groupvar}
fixed effects.  In this case, the CCV estimator defined in {help ccv##CCV:Abadie et al. (2023)}
section V will be implemented.  If not specified, OLS regressions are implemented.

{pstd}
{p_end} 
{phang}
{opt seed}({it:#})  seed define for pseudo-random numbers. This ensures that variance
estimates can be replicated exactly if desired, despite bootstrap resampling.

{pstd}
{p_end}
{phang}
{opt reps}({it:#}) number of repetitions used for conducting bootstrap resamples. Default is 50.
